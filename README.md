Top 5 EV Automobile Manufacturers in Washington


![EV By Brand in Washington](ev_washington.png)

This bar graph shows the top 5 producers of electric vehicles (EV) in Washington last updated October 21st 2022. More specifically, this includes both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs that are registered with the Washington Department of Licensing. I was interested to learn which automobile manufacturer would have the largest market share. I kind of expected Tesla to be the leader, but did not expect it to be so much more ahead of the other 4 competitors (Nissan, Kia, Ford, Chevrolet). This data comes from the [US Data Catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)
